In ExeUnitCore add Initialize method that initiates the Worker from Agreement
  - Consider how the constraints and properties are to be extracted, so that the detailed parameters of the ExeUnit are defined
    - the above includes resource amounts and eg. "payload" image location (the agreement must specify the location of application to be deployed)

 - ActivityController
 - ExeUnitCore
