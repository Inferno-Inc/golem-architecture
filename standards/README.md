# Golem Computation Resource Standards

## [TODO] Move the Standards Building Block framework article here to explain the approach and structure.

The Golem Standards repository consists of following sections:

* [0-commons](0-commons) - A collection of namespaces which specify generic aspects of Golem ecosystem. These namespaces are designed to be building blocks to which other, more area-specifc property namespaces may refer.
* [1-node](1-node) - A collection of namespaces containing properties which describe a Golem node - various aspects of Golem Requestor/Provider.
* [2-service](2-service) - A collection of namespaces containing properties which describe a Golem service or resource. A hierarchy of different **categories of services/resources** is defined.
* [3-commercial](3-commercial) - A collection of namespaces containing properties which describe commercial aspects of Golem ecosystem. All properties referring to **pricing**, **payments** or **licenses** are defined here.
