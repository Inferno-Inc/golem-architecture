# Golem Activity Capabilities
Namespace that describes Activity API capabilities, which can be perceived as "segments" of Activity API functionality.

Example segments can be:

- ways of transferring/specifying input for activity running on Provider node
- ways of obtaining/receiving output of activity running on Provider node

*Important:* 
- this standard also specifies both "caps pattern" of specification, ie. how an Offer indicates capabilites supported, and what capability namespaces are there.
- the "caps pattern" shall define the versioning and backward-compatibility specification guidelines.
