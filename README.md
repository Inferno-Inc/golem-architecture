This repository contains a number of documents defining the goal and
architecture for the Golem Project.

Each document has an index number, which roughly corresponds to the level of
abstraction it describes, with the most high-level documents getting the lowest
numbers.

The choice of using a collection of files, rather than a GitHub-specific wiki
format has a few reasons: 1) this allows for easier tracking of changes, 2) easy
way of verifying integrity and authenticity (via git signed tags and/or commits),
and 3) is not GitHub-specific.

The current maintainer of this repo is:

    Joanna Rutkowska
    joanna@invisiblethingslab.com
    github: @rootkovska
